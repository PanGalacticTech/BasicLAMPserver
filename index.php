Hello there, welcome to my Blog, Single Point of Failure. I am an Engineering student from London, I have been working in the Broadcasting industry for 7 years,
and I have started this page to document some of the projects I work on, and to act as a platform to test new ideas. I also spend my time playing guitar, producing
the occasional bit of music and building Stompbox Effects for Guitar and Bass as Pan Galactic FX.
